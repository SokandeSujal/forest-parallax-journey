      <p>
        Forests are the Earth's oldest living ecosystems, covering approximately
        31% of our planet's land surface. These ancient giants have stood as
        silent witnesses to centuries of change, hosting an intricate web of
        life within their depths. From the towering canopies to the rich forest
        floor, each layer tells a story of survival, adaptation, and endless
        renewal.

          A single mature tree can absorb up to 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per
          year and release enough oxygen to support two human beings.

      <p>
        Forests are home to 80% of the world's terrestrial biodiversity. A
        single hectare of rainforest may contain over 42,000 different species
        of insects, up to 807 trees of 313 species, and numerous birds, mammals,
        and reptiles. This incredible diversity makes forests essential for
        maintaining Earth's ecological balance.

        Every minute, we lose forest area equivalent to 40 football fields.
        Conservation efforts are crucial for preserving these invaluable
        ecosystems for future generations. Through sustainable practices and
        active reforestation, we can help protect these vital habitats that
        clean our air, purify our water, and stabilize our climate.
